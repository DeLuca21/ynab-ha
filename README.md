## üéâ **What's New in v1.2.5?**

This release includes **an important visibility fix for HACS users outside Australia**, as well as a **new diagnostic sensor** to help monitor integration health.

---

### üî• **Fixes & Changes**

‚úÖ **Integration Now Visible Globally in HACS**

- Previously, the integration‚Äôs `hacs.json` included `"country": "AU"`, which **limited its visibility to Australian users only**.    
- This line has been **removed**, making the integration **available to all users worldwide** in the HACS store.    
- If you couldn‚Äôt see the integration before ‚Äî you should now!    

‚úÖ **New Diagnostic Sensor: Last Successful API Poll**

- Added a helpful new sensor: `sensor.ynab_last_successful_poll`    
- This sensor tracks the **timestamp of the last successful API update**.
- Useful for **troubleshooting connectivity issues** or monitoring sync reliability.
- The sensor is included under the **"Extras" device** in Home Assistant.

---

## üöÄ Features

- **Multiple Budgets**: Configure multiple YNAB budgets.
- **Configurable Update Intervals**: Choose how frequently each budget‚Äôs data is refreshed.
- **Account Balances**: Pull real-time balances for any on-budget account and associated attributes.
- **Category Sensors**: Track each category‚Äôs balances and associated attributes.
- **Custom Budget ‚ÄúInstance Name‚Äù**: Each budget can have a unique prefix (e.g., ‚ÄúMel,‚Äù ‚ÄúJamie‚Äù) to avoid entity ID collisions. (Defaults to the YNAB budget name)
- **Currency Selection**: Choose your preferred currency (USD, EUR, etc.).
- **Monthly Summary Sensors**: Retrieve current month's summary data with associated attributes (e.g., `Budgeted`, `Activity`, `To Be Budgeted`, `Age of Money`).
