## 📊 Sensors Created

YNAB data is represented using **compact, attribute-rich sensors** — each account, category, and summary uses a single sensor packed with all relevant details.

### **API Status & Diagnostics**

The **API Status sensor**, located under the **Extras** device, provides comprehensive monitoring of your YNAB integration's health and API usage.

#### **Attributes for API Status:**

- **Status** (Default state value) – Current API connection status (`Connected`, `Rate Limited`, `API Error`, etc.)
- **Last Error** – Details of the most recent API error, if any
- **Last Error Time** – Timestamp of the last API error
- **Consecutive Failures** – Number of consecutive API failures
- **Requests Made Total** – Total API requests made across all YNAB integrations using the same token
- **Requests This Hour** – API requests made in the current rolling hour window
- **Rate Limit Resets At** – Time when the next request slot becomes available (rolling window)
- **Is At Limit** – Whether currently rate limited (`true`/`false`)
- **Last Successful Request** – Timestamp of the last successful API call

### **Accounts**

Each YNAB account is represented by a **single sensor** containing key financial attributes like balance, cleared total, and account type.

#### **Attributes for Accounts:**

- **Balance** – The total balance of the account, including both cleared and uncleared transactions.
- **Cleared Balance** (Default state value) – The balance of transactions that have been processed and cleared.
- **Uncleared Balance** – The balance of pending transactions that have not yet cleared.
- **On Budget** – Indicates whether the account is included in the budget (`true` for budgeted accounts, `false` for tracking accounts).
- **Type** – The type of account (e.g., `Checking`, `Credit Card`, `Savings`).

### **Categories**

Each category in your YNAB budget is exposed as a **single, attribute-rich sensor** that includes budgeted amount, spending, remaining balance, and goal tracking.

#### **Attributes for Categories:**

- **Budgeted** – The amount of money assigned to this category for the current month.
- **Activity** – The total amount spent in this category during the current month (negative means an expense).
- **Balance** (Default state value) – The remaining funds available in this category after subtracting activity from budgeted.
- **Category Group** – The parent group this category belongs to (e.g., "Bills," "Groceries").
- **Goal Type** – The type of goal set for this category (e.g., `Target Balance`, `Monthly Funding`).
- **Goal Target** – The total amount you aim to allocate or save for this category.
- **Goal Percentage Complete** – The percentage of progress toward the goal, based on the balance and target.
- **Goal Overall Left** – Remaining amount needed to meet the goal target.
- **Percentage Spent** – How much of the current month’s budget has been spent (0 – 100 %+).
- **Needs Attention** – `true` if the category is overspent or under‑funded.
- **Attention Reason** – `"Overspent"`, `"Underfunded"`, or `"Ok"`.

### **Latest Monthly Summary**

The **Monthly Summary sensor**, located under the **Extras** device, provides an overview of your current budget’s performance — including total activity, money to be budgeted, and average age of money.

#### **Attributes for Latest Monthly Summary:**

- **Budgeted** – The total amount of money assigned for the current month.
- **Activity** – (Default state value) The total amount spent for the current month.
- **To Be Budgeted** – The remaining funds available to be assigned for the current month.
- **Age Of Money** – The average age of your money, indicating financial stability.
- **Unapproved Transactions** – Transactions that haven’t been manually approved
- **Uncleared Transactions** – Still-pending transactions from active accounts
- **Overspent Categories** – Categories that went negative this month
- **Needs Attention Count** – A quick 0–3 score based on how many of the above are true
